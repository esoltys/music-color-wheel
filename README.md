# Music Color Wheel

An interactive visualization that maps musical notes to colors in a circular interface. Click notes to hear them play, or explore different scales, chord progressions, and familiar melodies.

## Features

- Interactive color wheel with 5 octaves of chromatic notes
- Real-time audio synthesis using Web Audio API
- Visual highlighting of scales (major, minor, pentatonic, blues, etc.)
- Chord progressions (triads, 7th chords, suspended chords)
- Famous melodies (nursery rhymes, classical pieces, holiday songs)
- Frequency display and note identification
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile

## Music & Color Theory

This visualization explores the fascinating relationship between musical and color harmonies:

**Frequency Relationships:**
- Musical octaves follow a 2:1 frequency ratio (C4 = 261.6Hz, C5 = 523.2Hz)
- Color octaves in light follow similar doubling patterns in wavelength
- Just as musical notes repeat every octave, colors cycle around the visible spectrum

**Harmonic Intervals:**
- **Perfect Fifth (3:2 ratio)**: C to G maps to complementary colors across the wheel
- **Major Third (5:4 ratio)**: Creates color triads similar to musical major chords
- **Minor Third (6:5 ratio)**: Produces more subtle, harmonious color relationships

**The Circle of Fifths:**
- Moving clockwise by 7 semitones (perfect fifths) creates the sequence: C-G-D-A-E-B-F#
- This maps to colors that create natural, pleasing progressions around the wheel
- Both music and color theory use circular representations for these relationships

## How it works

Each musical note is mapped to a specific color around the wheel:
- C = Red (0Â°), C# = Orange-Red (30Â°), D = Orange (45Â°), etc.
- Inner rings represent lower octaves, outer rings represent higher octaves
- Hover to see note names and frequencies
- Click to play individual notes
- Use the control panel to explore scales, chords, and melodies
